# Grade-Calculator
A Grade Calculator I created in high school for students to see what grades they would need to score on their final exams in order to pass with a certain desired grade in the class. <br /><br />
Note that my high school rounded upwards after x9.45% and may not be reflective of all schools' grading systems. Each marking period counts for 2/9 of the final grade and the final exam counts for 1/9. <br /><br />
